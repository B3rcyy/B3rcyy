**Hello**

I'm Bercyy, and I'm on a passionate journey of learning the Java programming language. 
This project brings together my Java skills with my deep love for Minecraft servers.

**Contents:**

**EcoCash** - Essentials-based Custom Item Retrieval Plugin

EcoCash is a custom item retrieval plugin built on top of Essentials for Minecraft servers. 
 With this plugin, you have the ability to create unique items containing names and customized model data. 
 Thanks to integration with Essentials, you can easily manage and retrieve these custom items on your own server.

**CMI Importer** - Seamless Currency Transfer from CMI to Essentials

The CMI Importer is a bridge plugin designed to streamline currency management between CMI (Customizable Math Interface) and Essentials on Minecraft servers. 
  With this plugin in place, you can effortlessly synchronize and transfer currency data from the CMI database to the Essentials economy system.

**AntiPlayer Fishing** - Player Tug Prevention

The goal of the AntiPlayer Fishing plugin is to prevent players from using fishing rods to tug each other on Minecraft servers. 
 This plugin does exactly what its name suggests: it prevents players from interfering with or pulling each other using fishing rods.

**Servers I've been on:**
Forcecraft
MiniMine
BurnCraft

**Currently:**
RivalsNetwork (ip.rivalsnetwork.hu)

If you have any further questions or anything specific you'd like to discuss about these servers, feel free to ask
